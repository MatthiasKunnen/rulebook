# TSLint
To provide consistency in TypeScript code and avoid shooting ourself in the foot it is a great aid
to use **TKTKTKTKTKT**

Add the following script to your package.json: `"lint:ts": "TKTKTKTKTKTK"`.
To run the linter execute `yarn run lint:ts` and to do automatic fixing, run
`yarn run lint:ts --fix`.
