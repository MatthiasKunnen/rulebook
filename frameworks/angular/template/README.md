# Angular Template
This directory contains some files to reuse for Angular projects.

# Set up
 - [Install Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/) (quickly using `npm i -g yarn`).
 - Run `yarn install --frozen-lockfile`

## Development server

Run `yarn run start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `yarn run ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `yarn run ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `yarn run ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `yarn run ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
